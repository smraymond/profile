		My name is Scott Michael Raymond, I am a 22 year old student at California State University San Bernardino, where I am 
		currently pursuing a degree in Computer Systems, with a focus on systems administration, as well as working as 
		an Information Technology Student Assistant. I made this website in order to display my technical skills to the 
		working world, as well as present components of my personal life.

		I graduated from Victor Valley College with an Associates degree in Computer Information Systems, and quickly 
		transferred to CSUSB to pursue higher education. I am pictured here with my parents at my graduation ceremony. 
		I was awarded Honors in my graduating class in addition to being a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society. 
		As great as it felt to complete Community College, I knew the real challenges were found in the Universities.

		I met my girlfriend Amanda back in my senior year of high school, and have been with her ever since. She also 
		attends CSUSB as a Nursing major, so we make sure to have each-other's backs during our studies.
